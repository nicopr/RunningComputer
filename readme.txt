Standalone APK which synchronizes with
- Metawatch Community Edition

Installation:

- Open Metwatach NE or CE, wait for the application to appear in "Watch Application" menu and select it.
- you now can select your options through the Metawatch Running Computer application: play with the options and check the watch display. Note that most options apply to "running" display
- the watch buttons can control either the track recording or the mediaplayer
  (1) pauses/resumes track recording
  (2) toggles running stats / GPS coordinates on the display
  (3) adds a waypoint

  long press on (1) toggles mediaplayer screen, the functions for each button are illustrated on the display

Thanks to Dedee for his Bico implementation. The running computer application reuses parts of his code.
