Running Computer for Metawatch
------------------------------

Standalone APK which synchronizes with
- Metawatch Community Edition
- Metawatch Noah Edition

Installation:
- Launch MetawatchRunningComputer.apk on your mobile
- Launch Metawatch Running Computer app
- Open Metwatach NE or CE, wait for the application to appear in "Watch Application" menu and select it.
- you now can select your options through the Metawatch Running Computer application: play with the options and check the watch display. Note that most options apply to "running" display
- the watch buttons can control either the track recording or the mediaplayer
  (1) pauses/resumes track recording
  (2) adds a waypoint

  long press on (1) toggles mediaplayer screen, the functions for each button are illustrated on the display

- Tap detection works only with my CE and watch firmware implementations:
  Double tap pauses/resumes track recording
  Single tap toggles Running/Mediaplayer screens


 
Thanks to Dedee for his Bico implementation. The running computer application reuses some parts of his code.
